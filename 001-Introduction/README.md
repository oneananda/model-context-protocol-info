# Core Concepts of MCP

MCP is a protocol that defines how contextual information (like user intent, preferences, session history, etc.) is exchanged between components of an AI system, especially between models and clients or orchestration layers.


Context: Structured information passed to the model (e.g., previous turns, user profile).

Messages: Units of communication between the client and the model.

Turns: A single round of interaction between the user and the model.

Components: Clients, model endpoints, routers/orchestrators.
