# 🧠 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Welcome to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) repository — your guide to building, hosting, and monetizing contextual interfaces for large language models (LLMs).**

## 🚀 What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a design pattern and interface protocol for structuring and serving contextual data to LLMs in a dynamic, modular, and programmable way.

Instead of manually prompting models with static instructions or large chunks of unstructured text, MCP allows developers to:
- Build **context servers** that stream live or cached context to models
- Modularize context into **named slots** (e.g. `identity`, `task`, `tools`, `history`)
- Enable tools, memory, profiles, and external data pipelines to dynamically feed the model

## 🧩 Why Use MCP?

Modern LLMs are only as effective as the **context** you provide them. MCP gives you:
- 🔧 **Structure**: Organize prompt inputs cleanly and flexibly
- 🌐 **Interoperability**: Reuse and update context across apps and sessions
- 💸 **Monetization-ready**: Sell premium context feeds, analytics, or APIs
- 🧠 **Automation**: Programmatically update memory, tools, or agent behavior
