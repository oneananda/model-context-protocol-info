# What is Context Modeling?

Context modeling is the process of capturing, structuring, and utilizing contextual information to enhance the performance and relevance of AI systems. It involves understanding user intent, preferences, and session history to provide more personalized and context-aware interactions.

## Core Concepts of Context Modeling

### Context as a Persistent Memory Carrier

Context acts as the structured memory shuttle — passed from the client to the model on each turn.

It doesn't just include history — it includes state, preferences, and environmental information.

Without context, a model is stateless and can't personalize or remember anything.

**Analogy: It's like the "backpack" of knowledge the model carries each time it speaks.**
